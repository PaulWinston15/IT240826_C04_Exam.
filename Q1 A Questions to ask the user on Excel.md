This article provides a summary of common mistakes people make when using eXcel. Here are a few that you should ask yourself

Have you matched the formula parentheses and brackets? These can get confusing when you are typing them. So, make sure your parantheses and brackets come in pairs.

Are the numbers formatted? When typing a formula in eXcel, a comma is usually used to seperate a function's arguments and a currency sign can create an absolute cell reference.

Finally, are all the required arguments in one eXcel function? Some functions have optional arguments and must be enclosed in square brackets. Otherwise, eXcel will display that there are too many arguments.
