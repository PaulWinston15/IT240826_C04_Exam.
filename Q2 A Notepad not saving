[Notepad will not save files.](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/notepad-will-not-save-files/d567549c-a705-4c64-81e2-be947c28a5bb) It was a pain to find.

However, it seems that the Microsoft community has pulled through with this one. As a member of the community has provided a very helpful answer involving the Permissions setting.

The one question I would ask is 'Does everyone have full control on the Notepad?' Right-click the file and turn off the security tag to give everyone full control of the Notepad. That should save the file if you close it again.
